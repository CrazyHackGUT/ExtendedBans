# Extended Bans
Simple, powerful ban system with support MySQL, SQLite

## Information
- This ban system is only in the development stage. Don't try compile and run this.
- The approximate date of the first alpha version is 01/06/2018 (01 Jun. 2018)
- API will be. ~~But this is not exactly.~~
- For building and correct work i recommend use SourcePawn 1.10 (**you must compile the compiler yourself**).
- I do not bear any responsibility for the damage caused by the plugin.

## Planned features
- **Offline ban**
- **Multi-ban**
- **DB queries queue**
- **Translations**
- **Nested ban reasons menus**

## System requirements
- **[SourceMod 1.9](https://sm.alliedmods.net/smdrop/1.9/)** or higher (1.8 also supports, but 1.8 has problems with transactions that cause server crashes)
- **Straight arms** (_this is not joke, you should can be able to edit **KeyValues** file and save him in **UTF-8 without BOM**_)
